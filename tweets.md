1. If you’ve seen our (@jrladd.com and @zoeleblanc.bsky.social) network analysis tool, Network Navigator, you might be interested in this article, which situates our work in the larger ecosystem of DH tools and explores the role of network analysis research tools as/in scholarly infrastructure.

2. Even as GUI tools seem so foundational in introductory DH pedagogy, at the same time they remain rarely debated or even defined as a category. We explore how this definitional problem makes it difficult to discern the ways DH tools are determining larger DH systems and infrastructure.

3. As a piece of DH infrastructure, Network Navigator is designed with people new to networks in mind, and it gives equal emphasis to flexible network visualization and quantitative network metrics.

4. Rather than adopting complex web frameworks, we used a simple set of web technologies—plain HTML, CSS, and JS where we could—and tried to let our understanding of research tool infrastructure guide us to a simpler, more sustainable development process.

5. By sharing not only our source code, but also our sources of inspiration and interpretation, we hope to contribute to the growing scholarship that seeks to complicate our understanding of “tool”-building and make visible the obscured interpretive work of DH infrastructure.
